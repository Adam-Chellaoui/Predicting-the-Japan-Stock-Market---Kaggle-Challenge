# Predicting-the-Japan-Stock-Market---Kaggle-Challenge
Notebooks I submitted for the Kaggle "JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange Prediction" challenge, where I developed both LSTM and LGBM models. The solutions were evaluated on the Sharpe Ratio produced by our models over a period of 3 months. I ranked 71/2033 (Top 4%).
